# GradCAM 
This project walks you through generating gradient-weighted class activation maps (GradCAMs) for model predictions.

- 🔍 This is similar to the CAMs you generated before except:
  - 📈 GradCAMs use gradients instead of the global average pooling weights to weight the activations.

## 🚀 Features
- 🖼️ Generate GradCAM visualizations for model predictions.
- 🧠 Utilize gradients for more precise activations.
- 🔄 Compatible with various deep learning models.
